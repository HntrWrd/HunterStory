There was a boy named bob.  Bob liked to go fishing.  He always has a great time fishing but today, something went wrong!On the weekend he went to the lake near his home for fishing. He had completely forgotten to bring his fishing rod from home. It turns out though, Bob was in luck. There was a fellow fisherman who had come by right as he realized he had no fishing rod. He had an extra rod!
